# NRW_GenAi_dhawily
As AI model we tried using the recommanded VOSK models(both: vosk-model-en-us-0.22 and vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph) but it wasn't good enough for our application even with applying a dynamic filter for noise cancellation. So we moved to the whisper base.en model that performed better than the previous one under similar conditions.
